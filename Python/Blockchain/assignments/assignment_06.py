# 2) Add another option to your user interface: The user should be 
# to output the data stored in the file in the terminal.
# 3) Store user input in a list (instead of directly adding it to 
# the file) and write that list to the file â€“ both with pickle 
# and json.
# 4) Adjust the logic to load the file content to work 
# with pickled/ json data.
